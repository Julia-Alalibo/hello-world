Hello humans

My name is Julia Alalibo
I am just about a Master degree holder in Advanced Chemical Engineering from the University of Aberdeen.
I am taking this course in Data Science because it has always held an appeal to me and I have a strong bias for solving problems with the aid of technology.
In some way, I have been exposed to the idea of data science and programming but just now, I want to build a solid foundation with the hopes of employing data-informed decisions to drive necessary changes and optimisation in my field of work.
